Created app.py and home.html
home.html is in the templates folder
As of now this basic two file structure allows users to input an address and have the address spit back out
The user can then reenter a new address
All future work will be built on this foundation, as home.html will display the results of looking up any adress

edited home.html to have two options:
  a) page will ask for permission of your current geolocation using js
  b) you can type in the address, js autofill

Edited design doc to reflect most recent changes: instead of inputting address all in one line, now form is split up into country, state/territory, city, street, house num, and ZIP. This allows simpler robustification.

Linked darksky api to weather.py. played with printing out data, began to consider how to process it for use in app.py.

Created maps.py, whihc introduced the google maps api that displays a map. This succeded, however, the dynamic maps that we want are dependet on a certain level of structure, struture that our adress input system does not offer. Additionally, when I try to use the geolocation feature I am met with a bad request resposne.
