Created app.py and home.html
home.html is in the templates folder
As of now this basic two file structure allows users to input an address and have the address spit back out
The user can then reenter a new address
All future work will be built on this foundation, as home.html will display the results of looking up any adress

kathyL -- 2016-12-05 21:40
edited home.html to have two options:
  a) page will ask for permission of your current geolocation using js
  b) you can type in the address, js autofill

vincentL -- 2016-12-05 21:45
Edited design doc to reflect most recent changes: instead of inputting address all in one line, now form is split up into country, state/territory, city, street, house num, and ZIP. This allows simpler robustification.

Linked darksky api to weather.py. played with printing out data, began to consider how to process it for use in app.py.

felixR -- 2016-12-05 10:51
Created maps.py, whihc introduced the google maps api that displays a map. This succeded, however, the dynamic maps that we want are dependet on a certain level of structure, struture that our adress input system does not offer. Additionally, when I try to use the geolocation feature I am met with a bad request resposne.

kathyL -- 2016-12-06 00:28
  fixed geolocation feature, added python functions in utils that can
  a) convert an address to geolocation (lat and lon)
  b) convert geolocation into a string address
  corrected display of maps

kathyL -- 2016-12-06 13:51
    fixed google maps bug

felixR -- 2016-12-06 19:45
Added an error message, that allows users to manually eneter tehir location if geolocation does not work.
Added Stylistic improvements to the product, especially teh presentation of the address on the site
Errors: the geolocation still does not work for me, perhpas internet specific--error is not as consistent as it previuoslly was?

Finished the icon pull fxn and started working on temp fxn. parsing data is much faster now that one fxn works. also spent time reading docs more closely and looking at a library someone else wrote for darksky api.

vincentL -- 2016-12-07 14:05
Finished function in movies.py that returns list of nearby movie theaters
To be implemented in app.py

vincentL -- 2016-12-07 22:10
There's now a movie theaters section where list of nearby movie theaters is displayed

felixR -- 2016-12-07 24:00
Added events.py
This file holds get_events, which returns a set number of events in your area via the meetup api
-will be intergrated into the full project soon

asherL -- 2016-12-08 0:24
Fixing weather.py, fxns for temp, background image, and humidity are finished.

kathyL -- 2016-12-08 7:55
display results in google maps, each marker w place name parsed and uploaded halal file.

felixR -- 2016-12-08 5:10
Linked the functions in events.py to the actual site, by means of app.py.
Asa result the events sectin of our site is complttly useable.
Major Bug Discovered--For some addresses: try typing 345 into the address bar and click the first suggested location.
For this location, after hitting enter, the site breaks, it supposedlly du eto ine 58 in app.py. I stronglly suspect, due to error messages and the like that teh error is due to non ascii charechters that are being pulled from teh foursquare api.

After creating a fxn in weather.py that takes in longitude and latitude and returns a list of a description of the weather, temperature, and humidity, I have attempted to enable app.py to use this info. I have tried to test it, but for some reason app.py will not print out the list even in the command line. Also I edited home.html to put in a place to display temp and humidity.

felixR -- 2016-12-09 11:40
Fixed the issues with the weather display. This is issues were due to print statements being used in liue of return statements, and the omission of the needed importation of the weather.py file. As a result, weather can now be displayed.
Bugs: weather's format needs to be wokred on.
